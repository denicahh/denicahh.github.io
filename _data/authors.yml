    Hello and thanks for visiting my site. It is something I am working on in my spare time so it is very much still a work in progress. 

    A little bit about me. I am a 27 year old Management Accountant who has decided to study a Bachelor of Computer Science on the side.
    There are quite a few reasons I have decided to pursue this study path but in short I want to be able to automate, innovate, create, harness, protect, learn, and grow. 

    In my personal life I enjoy going to the gym, attending the occaisional martial arts class, taking photos, and wrestling with my chocolate addiction. 

    While I learn to naviate the world of HTML and this blog I will be leaving myself little notes on where to locate the source of this text so I can edit it in future :)
