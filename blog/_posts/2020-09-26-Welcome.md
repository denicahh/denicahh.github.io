I have created this blog in an attempt to document my progress as I learn the skills required to enter the computer science world. I have been studying for two years (currently completing a bachelor degree) but I admit that I have not been diligent with applying my learnings outside of class and therefore I currently feel very underqualified with regards to my technical development. 

I am hoping to write about the things that I learn in order to solidify my learnings, and also to act as a point of reference. 

To be continued!
